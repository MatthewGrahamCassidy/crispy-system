Uncomplicated Firewall is a program for managing a netfilter firewall designed
 to be easy to use. It uses a command-line interface consisting of a small 
number of simple commands, and uses iptables for configuration.

First, ufw needs to be enabled. From a terminal prompt enter:
sudo ufw enable

To open a port (SSH in this example):
sudo ufw allow 22

Similarly, to close an opened port:
sudo ufw deny 22

To remove a rule, use delete followed by the rule:
sudo ufw delete deny 22

ufw can be disabled by:
sudo ufw disable

To see the firewall status, enter:
sudo ufw status

ufw Masquerading

First, packet forwarding needs to be enabled in ufw. 
Two configuration files will need to be adjusted, 
in /etc/default/ufw change the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to “ACCEPT”:
DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"

Then edit /etc/ufw/sysctl.conf and uncomment:
net/ipv4/ip_forward=1
net/ipv6/conf/default/forwarding=1

Now add rules to the /etc/ufw/before.rules file. The default rules only configure the filter table, 
and to enable masquerading the nat table will need to be configured.
Add the following to the top of the file just after the header comments:
# nat Table rules
*nat
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]

# Forward traffic from eth1 through eth0.
-A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these nat table rules won't be processed
COMMIT

when modifying any of the rules files in /etc/ufw, 
make sure these lines are the last line for each table modified:
# don't delete the 'COMMIT' line or these rules won't be processed
COMMIT

Finally, disable and re-enable ufw to apply the changes:
sudo ufw disable && sudo ufw enable
