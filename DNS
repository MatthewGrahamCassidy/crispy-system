Berkeley Internet Name Domain, otherwise known as BIND, is the most popular Domain Name System (DNS) 
server in use today. It was developed in the 1980s at the University of Berkley and is currently in version 9.
DNS is a hierarchical naming system for computers, services,or other resources connected 
to the Internet or a private network.

Configuring Bind9
The main configuration is stored within three files:
/etc/bind/named.conf
/etc/bind/named.conf.options
/etc/bind/named.conf.local

The default configuration is setup to act as a caching server.
Simply uncomment and edit the following in /etc/bind/named.conf.options:
[...]

        forwarders {
             1.2.3.4;
             5.6.7.8;
        };

        [...]
(where 1.2.3.4 and 5.6.7.8 are the IP numbers of your ISP's DNS servers)

now restart bind:
sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 restart

To add a DNS zone to BIND9, turning BIND9 into a Primary Master server,
 all you have to do is edit named.conf.local:
 [...]

        zone "example.com" {
             type master;
             file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
        };

        [...]

Now use an existing zone file as a template:
sudo cp /etc/bind/db.local /etc/bind/db.example.com

 create an A record for ns.example.com the name server in this example:
;
; BIND data file for local loopback interface
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     ns.example.com. root.example.com. (
                              1         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@       IN      NS      ns.example.com.
ns      IN      A       192.168.1.10

;also list other computers
box     IN      A       192.168.1.21

Once you've made a change to the zone file BIND9 will need to be restarted for the changes to take effect:
sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 restart

Now that the zone file is setup and resolving names to IP Adresses a Reverse zone is also required.
 A Reverse zone allows DNS to convert from an address to a name.
Edit /etc/bind/named.conf.local and add the following:
zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
        type master;
        notify no;
        file "/etc/bind/db.192";
};

Now create the db.192 file:
sudo cp /etc/bind/db.127 /etc/bind/db.192

Next edit /etc/bind/db.192 changing the basically the same options as in /etc/bind/db.example.com:
;
; BIND reverse data file for local loopback interface
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     ns.example.com. root.example.com. (
                              2         ; Serial
                         604800         ; Refresh
                          86400         ; Retry
                        2419200         ; Expire
                         604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@       IN      NS      ns.
10      IN      PTR     ns.example.com.

; also list other computers
21      IN      PTR     box.example.com.

The serial number in the reverse zone needs to be incremented on each changes as well. 
For each A record you configure in /etc/bind/db.example.com you need to create a 
PTR record in /etc/bind/db.192

After creating the reverse zone file restart bind9:
sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 restart

Testing
You should now be able to ping example.com on the command prompt 
and have it resolve to the host configured above:
ping example.com
